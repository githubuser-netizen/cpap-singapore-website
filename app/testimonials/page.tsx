      "In our everyday life, sleep is probably the most underrated activity that we do. Most would sleep less, just to fulfill other wants and needs in their lives. However, I am grateful that there is at least one person I know, who looks after the quality of my sleep I get, and that person is Jo. Being a sleep technologist, this is definitely not an inflated term for Jo. #1 Best use of education and technology, it's the yin and yang of problem solving. Jo is constantly keeping himself updated with the latest tips and technology tools that we can use to help achieve better sleep. It's not just about the number of hours, but also the quality. Having both quantitative and qualitative benchmarks, I was able to know whether I was sleeping or not. He is also trying to build a community to help people get more awareness when it comes to better rest. When you pay for his CPAP machine, you're getting more than just a product. #2 Top notch after sales journey. It's not just about the money. It's a customised experience. Starting off with a 2-week sleep test, Jo will collate the results and help identify whether sleep apnea as a major problem. From there, he will be able to advise whether intervention is required. If needed, it starts with a face-to-face consultation, where he will help us find the right fit for the device and the sleep mask. There is no restriction on the duration. I was given sufficient time to feedback on which is more suitable. After I was fitted with the right product, I was given a two week non-obligatory trial of the Bipap machine. Jo would follow up with me closely on my daily sleep, giving me directions on how I should change the settings to yield better sleep quality. Only when I'm certain that it worked for me, I was sent the invoice for payment. #3 Beyond a single product or service. Beyond just breathing better during sleep, Jo would also recommend the right lying-down position, suitable pillows and bedding products. Jo also works with other medical professionals and sleep product providers to be able to cater to your resting needs. It's not just one product or one man, you get a suite of sleep solutions when you consult with Jo. 2 in 3 Singaporeans suffer from sleep apnea. You may think you are getting enough rest. If you suffer from daytime tiredness, or constantly yawning in the day, you may be depriving your body of the rest it requires. Your journey to beauty rest can start right now with Jo.",

      "I've often been told by family and friends that I snore incredibly loudly, which led me to suspect that I might be suffering from sleep apnea. I reached out to Jo, who set me up with the O2 Ring for a sleep test. After using it for a few nights, the results confirmed that I do, in fact, have sleep apnea. Following a thorough assessment, Jo determined that I was a suitable candidate for CPAP therapy and recommended that I begin a trial. Throughout the entire process, Jo was incredibly patient and reassuring. He guided me through various mask fittings to determine which one offered the most comfort. He also experimented with different air pressure settings to find the optimal balance that would provide effective support without causing discomfort. Eventually I transitioned to a BiPAP machine which is an enhanced version of the traditional CPAP and began my therapy trial. During the 2 week period, I sent Jo my daily results and he made tailored adjustments to the pressure settings based on each night's data. Now that I've completed the trial, I can confidently say that I feel a remarkable difference in my energy levels. I no longer wake up feeling fatigued or unrested, even after a full 8 hours of sleep. A huge thank you to Jo for his patience, support, and expert guidance throughout this journey. I'm now a happy and well-rested BiPAP user and also a grateful patient of Jo's! Also much kudos to Jo for his dedication to raising awareness about this silent and insidious illness that can quietly take a toll on one's health and longevity. If you even slightly suspect that you may be experiencing sleep apnea, don't delay and swiftly reach out to Jo for a convenient, fuss-free diagnosis! Early intervention could mean adding more vibrant years to your life and creating many more cherished moments with your loved ones!",

I'm grateful to have found Jo, whose guidance has been invaluable throughout this process. His back to back support on Bipap / User experience has made navigating this new diagnosis much easier. Jo is also very helpful in optimising my BiPAP settings. The adjustments are ongoing, and we are hopeful for positive changes, typically on both my sleep quality and blood oxygen saturation levels. Really appreciate the support and guidance in this process. I highly recommend his assistance to anyone seeking information or support regarding sleep apnea and CPAP/BiPAP therapy.",

      "My hubby went for a sleep analysis test @ Govt hospital late last year and was diagnosed with serious sleep apnea. Decided to research on a CPAP machine to help with his sleep problem when I came across Jo via Tiktok. Had better insight of the CPAP machines he offered and contacted Jo from Yes CPAP. He's very attentive and knowledgeable on the sleep problems. Had eventually arranged for a tryout of the machines and bought one from Yes CPAP. The machine itself is affordable and my hubby feels comfortable using it. No more snores from him at night too! We had a trial machine from the Govt Hospital a few months back and my hubby feels YES CPAP ibreeze is no different (same function and serves same purpose to help with his sleep apnea and breathing) from popular brands selling at the hospital. Was grateful that Jo followed through my hubby's sleep journey, applying his skills and knowledge as a sleep therapist, suggesting tips and advices for a better sleep! Thank you Jo for your professionalism and friendly approach! Would highly recommend the product to my friends and relatives too!",

      "For as long as I can remember, I have always have an insanely bad snoring problem. It was so bad that during my stressful moments, my snoring would wake up my wife and she would decide to sleep in another room. I met Jo during an event and he shared with me how a CPAP machine could potentially help me. I was slightly skeptical but at this stage I was willing to try anything. So Jo came by with his equipment and we spend a good one and a half hour going through and setting up the very personalised settings for the CPAP machine. In that short session, I can tell Jo is extremely passionate about his work and from that, I had full trust in him. Before the session, I told Jo I had a very narrow nasal passage. So narrow that when I lie down my nostrils will start to close up and I have to breathe through my mouth. He was extremely patient with me. We went through 3 different mask types until we found a one that was suitable for my facial structure and that the air could effortlessly pass through my nostril passageway. When the setup and customisation was done, and the pressured air was delivered, I was in shock. My first thought was 'Is this how breathing is suppose to be?' It was a life changing moment. And as I wake up from my first night of using the CPAP machine, my first night of no snoring, no interrupted sleep, I felt I had to write this review. To let people know there are solutions out there that can literally change lives. Thanks Jo for introducing this to me. I will forever be grateful",

      "I am 49, male Singaporean. I had just started using CPAP for about 1 month now. In the past, I never understood why a few things happened to me. BP- I went to the extend of doing expensive heart scans and checks with full blood test. Everything was normal but I just cannot understand why the BP still high. Dr said can be hereditary. I am on low dosage of BP meds for about 2 years now. Snoring - My wife said my snoring is so bad. Sleep cycle- I never get good sleep. Everynight i am always woken to go toilet or just woken up in the middle of the night for no reason and find it hard to go back to sleep. Sleepy during the day- I often get sleepy the moment I sit down watching TV or reading or driving. For Just a month after using CPAP. Here are my personal experiences. BP- I stop taking BP meds. My BP dropped to safe zone. Snoring- the snoring stopped. Sleep cycle - I stopped going to the toilet in the middle of the night. I slept through. Sleepy during the day- my wife told me I am less tired during the day time. Driving without feeling sleepy. Good after sales service was beyond my expectations. Jo helped me through every step of the way. I hope to help others too.",

From the start, Jo's in-depth knowledge about the product was evident. He patiently explained every feature and benefit of the CPAP machine, addressing all my questions and concerns, which made me feel confident in my purchase. Over the past year, the improvement in my sleep quality has been remarkable. I now wake up feeling refreshed and energized, a significant change from before.

I was also given the opportunity to try different CPAP machines in the comfort of my own home, lying down, to identify the correct machine and settings.

      "Very satisfied with the CPAP therapy and after service. Worth the value especially most of us are not expertise in sleep apnea. I started to have mild apnea 5 years ago when my closed one noticed of loud snoring and gasping of air during middle of the night. Increasing lack of sleep, inactive and fat, more OT at night worsen the apnea. I was stubborn and ignore until one year ago more serious symptoms started to show. Floating and tiredness throughout the day about 3-4 days a week, waking up 2-3 times a night and frequent memory loss. There was a night which my mind was clear but my body started to collapse twice which i cant forget. Started researching and even tried cheaper option such as mouthguard, tape but doesn't really help they will be spit out eventually. While exercising more, sleep more and eating healthily do helps reduce apnea but symptoms like gasping for air and snoring still occurs. Even day time headaches do occurs sometimes. After doing more research found out about CPAP therapy and eventually choses YES CPAP due to good reviews. Service: Jo went the extra effort to visit my house and let me try different masks and machines to choose the most suitable set for my daily use. He was patient on giving advice and very knowledgeable on sleep apnea. He even provides Personalised Pressure optimization journey and explained the details on the machine. Yes there is warranty and he is very responsive on any questions after sales. He will also initiate to give tips on better sleep besides CPAP which is not seen anywhere. After using CPAP Comparison: Might be uncomfortable initially but i manage to sleep throughout the night without waking up and no snoring heard at home. Feels more energised than before too. Some might argue can get cheaper somewhere with no advice or after service worst no warranty, but Health is Wealth. There are monthly instalment via diff app if needed. Yes will continue use CPAP therapy as it benefitted me a lot.",

      "I am 49, male Singaporean. I had just started using CPAP for about 1 month now. In the past, I never understood why a few things happened to me. BP- I went to the extend of doing expensive heart scans and checks with full blood test. Everything was normal but I just cannot understand why the BP still high. Dr said can be hereditary. I am on low dosage of BP meds for about 2 years now. Snoring - My wife said my snoring is so bad. Sleep cycle- I never get good sleep. Everynight i am always woken to go toilet or just woken up in the middle of the night for no reason and find it hard to go back to sleep. Sleepy during the day- I often get sleepy the moment I sit down watching TV or reading or driving. For Just a month after using CPAP. Here are my personal experiences. BP- I stop taking BP meds. My BP dropped to safe zone. Snoring- the snoring stopped. Sleep cycle - I stopped going to the toilet in the middle of the night. I slept through. Sleepy during the day- my wife told me I am less tired during the day time. Driving without feeling sleepy. Good after sales service was beyond my expectations. Jo helped me through every step of the way. I hope to help others too.",
